# House Price Prediction

A machine learning model that predicts house prices using various features like location, size, and amenities. Built with XGBoost and scikit-learn for accurate real estate valuation.

## 📋 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution to predict residential property prices based on various features. The model helps in estimating house prices, which can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in making informed real estate decisions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- scikit-learn for machine learning
- XGBoost for gradient boosting
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
